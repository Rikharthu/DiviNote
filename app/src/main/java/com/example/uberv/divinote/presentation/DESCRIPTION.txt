Outer layer.
Presentation package is responsible for everything related to showing things on the screen.
It includes the whole MVP stack (both UI and Presenter packages even though the belong to different layers)

Is here, where the logic related with views and animations happens.
It uses no more than a Model View Presenter (MVP from now on), but you can use any other
pattern like MVC or MVVM. I will not get into details on it, but here fragments and activities
are only views, there is no logic inside them other than UI logic, and this is where all the
rendering stuff takes place.

Presenters in this layer are composed with interactors (use cases) that perform the job in a new
thread outside the main android UI thread, and come back using a callback with the data that will
be rendered in the view.

Model <--- Presenter <---> View

Uses interactor to communicate with the Domain Layer

- Model represents a ViewModel
