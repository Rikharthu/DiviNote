- Model represents an Entity
- All data needed for the application comes from this layer through a Repository pattern implementation
  (The interface is in the domain layer)
- Ofter a factory pattern is used to pick different data sources depending on certain conditions, such
  as using Cloud to fetch data or Database/File to present cached data
  (For instance, when getting a user by id, the disk cache data source will be selected if
  the user already exists in cache, otherwise the cloud will be queried to retrieve
  the data and later save it to the disk cache.)

- Data origin is transparent for the client, which doesn't care whether data is coming from a memory,
  disk or the cloud. It just must be fetched and provided
